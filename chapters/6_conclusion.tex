- Summary: We proposed a new loss function based on the Jones calculus which was then used in the design process. 
\newline
    - Add about formbirefringence
    \newline
    - Also compared the optimization result to another result obtained with a different objective function. (Ceramic)
\newline
We tested the design obtained from optimizing the loss function by 3D printing and subsequently characterizing the waveplate/structure. It was not done by us, not sure if needs to be mentioned again. 
\newline
- Large deviation but we could identify a likely cause. We did see a broadband response compared to a single waveplate.
\newline
- Outlook: What more can be done? What I'm doing now lol. We can get better results fairly easy...
