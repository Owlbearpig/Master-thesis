-TODO Add E perp to K and B etc. in beginning of maxwell stuff...

-TODO maybe add small note about why dealing with single frequency makes sense -> fft, superposition principle stuff (griffiths explains it 7.12 or something)

-indexellipsoid (done?)

- Important. Mention jones matrices can depend on several parameters in general, like wavelength or other stuff ... think it's described in Hecht (done)

- differential jones matrices, mby interesting, could be outlook ... contionous changing stripe widths or something like that

- retardation dephasing (masson, wu) vs retardance (eigenvalues) coincide for psi_i = 0
