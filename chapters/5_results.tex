We investigated three versions of the AWP design described in the last section of the previous chapter. The first type we present is based on 3D printed \ce{Al2O3}, the second type is produced using ordinary 3D printed polymers and the third type consists of SLE fused silica glass waveplates as described in the previous chapter. The results are obtained through the minimization of the two objective functions defined in the previous chapter.

% This AWP type differs from the other two in the sense that the phase shift is not caused by form birefringence, but instead by intrinsic birefringence which stems from the crystallographic orientation of the material. The second type is similar to the fused silica glass AWP in the sense that it is also based on form birefringence but the structure is 3D printed by typical of the birefringence is not from the structure but instead on the crystallographic orientation of the material. 

\section{Ceramic AWP}
In a publication by Ornik et al. it was shown that \ce{Al2O3} as a 3D printed ceramic exhibited birefringent properties. A birefringence of approximately $0.05$ was reported. This value is fairly low compared to the birefringence of sapphire which is the crystalline form of \ce{Al2O3} with a birefringence of approximately $0.32$.

It was further shown that the direction of the slow axis was parallel to the printing direction. A sketch of how the samples are printed is shown to the left in figure \ref{fig:ornik1abc}, where the arrow indicates the printing direction. The top right side shows an actual image of the green sample and the bottom right shows an image of the sample after sintering. For the sintering step the sample is slowly heated to \SI{1700}{\celsius} which causes it to shrink, in this case by around \SI{21}{\volpercent}. In total two different samples were characterized and the result of this characterization is shown in figure \ref{fig:ri_abs} \cite{Ornik2021}. The left plot shows the measured refractive index and the birefringence along the slow and fast direction for the two samples as a function of the frequency, while the right plot shows the measured absorption coefficient for the two samples and directions as a function of the frequency. We see that within the error range the birefringence of the two samples is equal. Therefore, either sample parameters works for setting up the loss function, we use the measurement result from sample 1.

The right plot shows the absorption coefficient, again for the slow and fast axis of the samples. Data: \cite{Ornik2021}}

Stacking a number of these ceramic discs or plates like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:ornik1abc} we can in theory construct an AWP similar to the TAQ by Masson. This ceramic AWP can then serve as a comparison to the TAQ and therefore also partly as a verification of the loss function at least for the $\lambda/4$ AWP type. In this case the loss functions $L_{\lambda/4}$ and $L_{\lambda/2}$ only depend on the set of angles and thicknesses. In other words the birefringence does not change at each iteration and is the same for each individual plate. An AWP of this type consisting of three ceramic discs is shown in figure \ref{fig:ceramic_stack}. Each disc has two flat sides where one is used for alignment and the other is the printing base. The alignment flat is placed keeping in mind that the slow axis is along the printing direction. In reality the discs are stacked so that ideally no air gaps in between each waveplate exists.

The red arrow points to the supportive base which is therefore the printing direction and hence the slow direction.}

We can obtain the birefringence of quartz using the reported values in \cite{DGrischkowsky1990}. Subsequently, the Sellmeier equation allows us to interpolate the values in the available data range which is from \SIrange{0.2}{2.0}{\tera \hertz}, details can be found in the appendix section \ref{sec:sellmeier}. Using the thicknesses and angles of the TAQ given in table \ref{tab:masson_result} as well as the birefringence of quartz we can then calculate $L_{\lambda/4}(\nu)$ for the TAQ and use it for comparison. To that end we optimized $L_{\lambda/4}$ for $n=6$ in the range from \SIrange{0.25}{1.50}{\tera \hertz}. The design parameters obtained from this optimization are shown in table \ref{tab:res_cl4} (Result 1). Additionally, the terms of $L_{\lambda/4}(\nu)$ of this result as well as those for the TAQ are plotted in figure \ref{fig:loss_function_cl4} as a function of frequency. We see that the magnitude of $L_{\lambda/4}$ for these two results is similar. This indicates that $L_{\lambda/4}$ is also a suitable measure of the quality of the result similar to $L_{M}$. At around \SI{1.5}{\tera \hertz} there is a clear a cut-off for result 1 after which $L_{\lambda/4}$ increases steeply. This steep increase starts at around \SI{1.6}{\tera \hertz} for the TAQ. Defining the bandwidth as the ratio between the upper and lower frequency we get a value of  $\frac{\SI{1.5}{\tera \hertz}}{\SI{0.3}{\tera \hertz}}=5$.

The right subfigure shows the values of $L_M$ and $L_{\lambda/4}$ for the TAQ with respect to the frequency. The largest difference between the two is around \SI{0.5}{\tera \hertz} and \SI{0.7}{\tera \hertz}, otherwise the trend of the two functions is relatively similar.}
    \label{fig:loss_function_cl4}
\end{figure}

Similar to quartz, the birefringence of the ceramic plates is relatively low. This in turn means that for the waveplates to have an effect in the lower end of the spectrum the individual plates must be fairly thick so that we get a total thickness of around \SI{32}{\milli \meter}. Although, if we shift the frequency range of the optimization to \SIrange[range-phrase=-, range-units=single]{0.5}{2.25}{\tera \hertz} then we obtain a second result (result 2) for which the bandwidth is almost five as well $\left(\frac{\SI{2.25}{\tera \hertz}}{\SI{0.5}{\tera \hertz}}=4.5\right)$. With that the total thickness of the AWP can be reduced to \SI{26}{\milli \meter} compared to the \SI{32}{\milli \meter} of result 1. The design parameters of result 2 are given in the lower half of table \ref{tab:res_cl4} and the dotted line in the left subfigure of figure \ref{fig:loss_function_cl4} shows the individual terms of $L_{\lambda/4}$ for each frequency bound by the available material data range. The right subfigure shows a comparison between $L_M(\nu)$ and $L_{\lambda/4}(\nu)$ for the TAQ. We see that the shape of the two functions match fairly well except for the lower frequencies and especially at around \SI{0.55}{\tera \hertz} we see a large deviation. Figure \ref{fig:cl4_alpha} shows $\alpha$ for the output state given a horizontal linear polarized input as a function of the frequency for result 1 and the TAQ. Since $\alpha$ is a measure of the ellipticity of the output state it shows the difference between a circle and the shape of the output. For a circle $\alpha$ is $\arctan(1)=\SI{45}{\degree}$ which is therefore the target value. If we compare $\alpha$ for the TAQ and at the frequency \SI{0.55}{\tera \hertz} to $L_{\lambda/4}$ at the same frequency, we see that the large deviation from the optimum is correctly indicated by $L_{\lambda/4}$ while $L_M$ shows a minimum and thereby fails to recognize the deviation. We see the same situation at around \SI{0.75}{\tera \hertz}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \caption{$\alpha$ of the output state as a function of the frequency given a horizontal linear input for the TAQ and result 1. Ideally given a linear input the output should have an $\alpha$ of \SI{45}{\degree} independent of frequency. We see that the deviation of result 1 from the optimum is distributed more evenly on the frequency range, while for the TAQ the deviation is higher at lower frequencies.}
    \label{fig:cl4_alpha}
\end{figure}

Considering that $L_M$ and $L_{\lambda/4}$ are calculated from the same Jones matrix, which is constructed from the parameters of the TAQ and crystalline quartz, it shows that at least for some frequencies $L_{\lambda/4}$ is better at identifying deviations of the output from the optimal CP state. This could be due to the fact that the value of $L_{\lambda/4}$ is directly measures the deviation of the output from the RCP state.

We can calculate the thickness required to cause a quarter wave shift at the minimum of the frequency range for a linear input state with an azimuth of \SI{45}{\degree}. In other words the thickness of a zero order quarter waveplate at the minimum frequency, this is given by equation $\ref{eq:thickness_quarter_waveplate}$. In this case the minimum frequency is \SI{0.25}{\tera \hertz} at which the birefringence is $\Delta n = 0.047$. The required thickness is therefore approximately $d_{\lambda/4}=\frac{\SI{1200}{\micro \meter}}{4\cdot0.047}=\SI{6.38}{\milli \meter}$. Comparing this value to the total thickness of result 1 we see that it is around five times lower than the total thickness and almost \SI{4}{\milli \meter} thinner than the thickest plate. If we keep in mind that a probabilistic algorithm is part of the optimization method, then this could indicate that result 1 is not the thinnest possible configuration for the given frequency range and material. On the other hand however, we have to keep in mind that $d_{\lambda/4}$ is for an angle of \SI{45}{\degree} while the six plates of result 1 are at different angles reducing the phase shift caused by each plate. It is therefore questionable whether we can actually directly compare $d_{\lambda/4}$ to the total thickness. 

Furthermore, if we consider two results where the total thickness of the latter is larger, then the magnitude or intensity of the corresponding output state will in general be lower compared to the output of the first result. However, $L_{\lambda/4}(\nu)$ is insensitive to isotropic changes in the absorption. So if the ellipticity and orientation of the polarization ellipses corresponding to the two results are equal for all frequencies then $L_{\lambda/4}$ will attain the same value in both cases. In other words, $L_{\lambda/4}(\nu)$ is the same for two states $\bm{\mathcal{E}}$ and $p\bm{\mathcal{E}}$, $0<p<1$ for any frequency. The intensity coefficients $p_1^2$ and $p_2^2$ for the equivalent elliptic diattenuator Jones matrix describing the result with a larger total thickness will both be scaled by $p^2$. Since in the definition of $L_{\lambda/4}$ the elements of the Jones matrix enter as a ratio, the factor $p^2$ then subsequently cancels out and both results will attain the same value of $L_{\lambda/4}$. This in turn means that there is no direct penalty for increasing the thicknesses other than increasing the effect of dichroism.

    \label{fig:cl4_convergence}
\end{figure}

To address the question whether result 1 is the global minimum or if there is a better suited one we plotted the minimum value of $\sum_{\nu}L_{\lambda/4}(\nu)$ as function of the current iteration step in figure  \ref{fig:cl4_convergence}. We see that the algorithm converges fairly fast and there are only major changes in the first 25 iterations. This indicates that finding a solution with $n=6$ which performs significantly better in the range of \SIrange{0.25}{1.50}{\tera \hertz} is unlikely using the current algorithm and loss function.

Figure \ref{fig:cl4_pe_lp} shows the polarization ellipses of the normalized states at seven different frequencies given an initial linear horizontal input. The ellipses for the output of the TAQ is shown in the left subfigure while the right is for result 1. The arrows indicate the handedness of the polarization. We see that as expected we get LCP states in the frequency range in which the optimization took place. Outside of that range the states are significantly more elliptical. We also see a slightly better result for the intermediate frequencies compared to the lowest at \SI{0.3}{\tera \hertz}.

    \label{fig:cl4_pe_cp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cl4_pe_cp} is similar to figure \ref{fig:cl4_pe_lp} except that the input in this case is LCP. We know from the previous sections that a quarter waveplate should produce a linear polarized output for a circular polarized input. We see that this is the case for the TAQ up to at least \SI{1.50}{\tera \hertz}, after which the state increasingly deviates from the linear ellipse shape. Interestingly the ellipses of result 1 have a lower ellipticity compared to those of the TAQ, which indicates that the TAQ is better suited for turning a circular polarized input into a linear polarized output. The reason for this could be that we only consider the circularity of the output state in the loss function used to obtain result 1, while for the TAQ the resulting phase shift was directly optimized. This could therefore indicate that it is not sufficient to only consider the circularity of the output state in the loss function and a measure of the linearity should be included as well. Although, on the other hand the relatively large deviation that can be seen at \SI{1.50}{\tera \hertz} can also be recognized in the plot of the loss function in figure \ref{fig:loss_function_cl4}. Which means that the deviation is recognized by the loss function but a minimum was not found that minimizes $L_{\lambda/4}$ at this point. This could therefore further indicate that it is more difficult to minimize $L_{\lambda/4}$ compared to minimizing $L_M$.

The circular and linear polarization degrees $V_c$ and $V_l$ for a linear input state is shown in figure \ref{fig:cl4_pol_deg} as a function of frequency for result 1 and the TAQ. Subfigures (a) and (c) show the full frequency range of $V_c$ and $V_l$ respectively, while subfigures (b) and (d) show the first \SI{1.6}{\tera \hertz}. For clarity $V_c$ is offset by one in (b) so that values of $V_c$ closer to zero are in fact closer to negative one. We see that as expected $V_c$ is around $-1$ in the optimization range for both the TAQ and result 1 which indicates that the light is almost purely LCP. Interestingly, outside of the optimization frequency range the light switches to be primarily RCP. Furthermore, subfigure (b) shows that $V_c$ for result 1 varies less for frequencies below \SI{0.6}{\tera \hertz} and more for higher frequencies compared to the TAQ and varies less overall. This could be due to the difference between the refractive indices used for quartz during optimization and the values used for the calculation of $V_c$, since these deviations are fairly small. From subfigure (c) we see that the linear polarization degree increases to one and decreases again while the light switches to RCP. Subfigure (d) shows a similar trend as (b) in the sense that result 1 is closer to zero at lower frequencies compared to the TAQ. We also see that $V_l$ is not zero, the light is therefore not perfectly CP but also partly LP, which is difficult to see in the polarization ellipse representation.

Using the values for the absorption coefficient of quartz reported in \cite{DGrischkowsky1990} we can calculate the intensity of the light after passing through the \SI{31.45}{\milli \meter} thick TAQ. We can carry out the same calculation for the ceramic AWP designs; result 1 and the slightly thinner result 2 which have a total thickness of \SI{31.94}{\milli \meter} and \SI{26.24}{\milli \meter} respectively. The transmission as a function of frequency for these three designs is shown in figure \ref{fig:cl4_intensity}, where the right subfigure shows the range in which the optimization took place in the case of result 1. We clearly see that even though the three designs have an almost equal total thickness the insertion loss of the ceramic AWPs is several orders of magnitude higher compared to the quartz TAQ, which limits the practicality of ceramic AWPs.
A possibility to reduce the significance of this could be to decrease the bandwidth of the ceramic AWP and thereby also decrease the required total thickness. Another possibility to partly circumvent this problem could be to simply only use the lower frequency range where the absorption is lower. Additionally, the intensity of the lower frequency components is higher, at least in the case of the THz-TDS systems used in this work. Since apparently the birefringence of 3D printed \ce{Al2O3} depends on the printing process it might be possible to enhance the birefringence by modifying the printing process, which in turn means that the total thickness can be reduced. The latter is still work in progress.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cl4_params} shows the two sets of parameterization angles ($\alpha$, $\delta$) and ($\psi$, $\chi$) for result 1 and the TAQ as a function of frequency. We see that the values of $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are around \SI{45}{\degree} and \SI{270}{\degree} respectively for both result 1 and the TAQ indicating LCP. Again, similar to what the polarization degree showed we see a transition to RCP outside of the optimized frequency range, where in the case of result 1 the transition is sharper. For both the TAQ and result 1 the transition happens via a decrease of $\delta$. Since the phase shift is proportional to the birefringence times the path length and increases for increasing frequency it could indicate that the birefringence is negative. Furthermore, since $\delta = \delta_y - \delta_x$ and $\delta$ decreases for frequencies above approximately \SI{1.6}{\tera \hertz}, it shows that the phase of the x-component advances faster which in turn could indicate that the fast axis is partly along the x-axis. The x-axis is defined as the axis along which the incident light is polarized. Additionally, we see a bump in $\alpha$ around \SI{1.75}{\tera \hertz}. This is likely due to the same reason that causes the sharper decrease of $\delta$ for result 1 compared to the TAQ, since $\delta$ and $\alpha$ are related via $\sin(2\chi)=\sin(2\alpha)\sin(\delta)$ and the trend of the ellipticity $\chi$ is similar in both cases. We further see that the azimuth $\psi$ changes rapidly with frequency. This means that if we were to use two identical AWPs of this type in series to create a $\lambda/2$ AWP it likely would not have the desired effect, since the output state is highly dependent on the azimuth of the input. As a reminder, the azimuth of the input state for all frequencies and in all cases shown so far is zero.

The values of $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are as expected for LCP as well as after the transition to RCP for both designs. The variation of the azimuth $\psi$ makes it impossible to place two of these designs in series to form a $\lambda/2$ AWP. As expected, for LCP and RCP frequencies $\chi$ attains a value of plus or minus \SI{45}{\degree} respectively.}

\end{figure}

The calculated retardance as well as the diattenuation for both the TAQ and result 1 is shown in the left and right subfigure of figure \ref{fig:cl4_ret_diat} respectively. The retardance and the diattenuation of an optical element is obtained directly from the Jones matrix describing the element and is therefore independent of the input state. Additionally, as a reminder the retardance and diattenuation are, respectively, defined as the phase and relative intensity transmittance difference between the eigenpolarizations after passing the waveplate. It can be shown that this phase shift and transmittance difference are the maximum possible of all states \cite{Lu1994}. 

We see that the diattenuation is increasing with frequency similar to the dichroism. Since quartz has a lower amount of dichroism compared to the \ce{Al2O3} ceramic we also find that the diattenuation of the TAQ is smaller compared to the ceramic waveplate. Even though the diattenuation is several orders of magnitude higher for result 1 we still theoretically see a similar performance compared to the TAQ. This means that either the influence of dichroism on the performance is less significant or the model accounts for it correctly. Additionally, the sharp spikes around \SI{0.5}{\tera \hertz} and \SI{0.9}{\tera \hertz} are the frequencies where the dichroism is almost zero or in other words the absorption is direction independent, which we also recognize in figure \ref{fig:ri_abs}. 

Furthermore, any state that is not an eigenstate will experience a smaller phase shift and compared to the retardance at a given frequency. This means that the retardance is an indicator of the order of the waveplate since it shows the maximum possible number or fractions of shifted wavelengths, both results can therefore be considered as zero order waveplates since the retardance is less than $2\pi$ \cite{Samoylov2004}. 
%Furthermore, in the frequency region where the optimization took place we see an approximately linear increase of the retardance with frequency for both results which is likely explained by the linear relationship between the phase shift and frequency given by equation \ref{eq:wp_eq}. The following steep decrease is typical for a single zero order quarter waveplate as can be seen in for example .

    \label{fig:cl4_ret_diat}
\end{figure}

Another interesting property are the principal axes of the waveplate. In case of a single birefringent linear retarder the principal axes are simply the fast and slow axis of the birefringent material; in other words linear polarization states for which the polarization planes align with the principal axes of the material. Although in general these axes are not always linear since they can be defined as the fastest and slowest propagating states of the optical element. For any given optical element the effective principal axes are therefore simply the eigenstates of the respective Jones matrix. As mentioned earlier these are also the states that are retarded the most or in other words most effectively phase shifted relative to each other. 

To that extend we calculated the eccentricity and azimuth of the eigenstates for the TAQ and result 1 which is shown in figures \ref{fig:cl4_eigenstate_eccentricity} and \ref{fig:cl4_eigenstate_azimuths} respectively. We expect that the eccentricity is one and zero for linearly and circular polarized states respectively. It shows that the principle axes are elliptically polarized in the optimization frequency range for both the TAQ and result 1, which are therefore both elliptical waveplates. This also shows that these composite achromatic waveplates in general are not linear waveplates even though for an individual chromatic waveplate this is the case.

\end{figure}

% TODO Fix phasewraps in plots (done)

We see that the azimuth shown in figure \ref{fig:cl4_eigenstate_azimuths} of the two eigenstates and thereby the angle of the effective principle axes for the TAQ and result 1 is slightly dispersive. Furthermore, we see that the axes do not align with any of the axes of the individual plates. This behavior of the principle axes can be a problem for certain applications such as in the measurement of the polarization of the light from stars. Since then the axial dispersion results in changes in the orientation of the reference frame used to describe the determined Stokes parameters according to the frequency range \cite{Clarke2004, Bailey2019}. Although, since the plates in this work are supposed to be used for conversation of a certain state into another it is not as detrimental. Even though the axes are not independent of wavelength it is worth noting that the axes are at least pairwise orthogonal.

    \label{fig:cl4_eigenstate_azimuths}
\end{figure}

Since the input in the context of this work is linearly polarized we would ideally want the eigenstates to be linear. Furthermore, we get an interesting result in case of negligible dichroism. The Jones matrix $\hat{T}$ representing the composite waveplate can then be written as given in equation \ref{eq:equiv_matrix} or specifically as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{T} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
    A & B \\
    -B^* & A^*
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
If we then calculate the eigenstates we get the condition that they are linear if $\operatorname{Re}A=0$. In this case the retardation dephasing $\Delta_M$ given by equation \ref{eq:retardation_dephasing} coincides with the retardation defined as the absolute phase or angle difference between the two complex eigenvalues. Furthermore, in case of a half waveplate $A$ is purely imaginary \cite{McIntyre1968}. This means that it is sufficient to simply minimize $\operatorname{Re}A$.

To verify the design concept experimentally a set consisting of five ceramic discs similar to the three sketched in figure \ref{fig:ceramic_stack} as well as five additional test samples were produced by a third party. We characterized the newly printed samples but unfortunately they showed almost no birefringence, which therefore made them useless as waveplates. The description of the samples and the results of the measurement are shown in the appendix section \ref{sec:ceramic_characterization}. 

However, a design concept we could verify experimentally is the one based on form birefringent waveplates. This will be discussed in the following section.

\section{Composite AWP based on form birefringent polymer waveplates}
The concept of form birefringent polymer waveplates is similar to the form birefringent silica waveplates described at the end of chapter \ref{ch:theory}. Specifically, instead of using SLE to create the form birefringent stratified structures we used a commercial 3D printer, in this case the Prusa i3 MK3S+. A 3D printer simply liquifies a polymer filament which is then deposited layer by layer at certain positions to create the structure given by a design file. Therefore, compared to SLE the process of 3D printing is different in the sense that it is an additive process while SLE is subtractive.  

As a first step in the design process we chose a polymer which we would use for printing of the structures. Based on the measurements published in \cite{Busch2014} of seven different 3D printed polymer samples possibly suited for THz optics we selected high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and polypropylene (PP). These two polymers were shown to have a relatively low absorption coefficient at \SI{500}{\giga \hertz} which is a common property of most non-polar polymers \cite{Jordens2010, Castro-Camus2020} and low absorption is important since the final composite waveplate is rather thick. A \SI{2}{\milli \meter} thick rectangular sample of each material were printed and subsequently characterized using the GHz setup described in \ref{sec:GHz_setup}. The refractive index and absorption coefficient obtained from the measurement is shown in figure \ref{fig:HIPS_PP_ri}. We see that the refractive index does not change much over the frequency range for both materials. The absorption coefficient is slightly lower for PP compared to HIPS, which would make it better suited. Unfortunately, using PP we were only able to print squares due to its high flexibility and thermal expansion. All subsequent structures were therefore printed using the HIPS filament.

    \caption{Measured refractive index and absorption coefficient of the \SI{2}{\milli \meter} HIPS and PP samples. The tails at the frequency boundaries are system artifacts.}
    \label{fig:HIPS_PP_ri}
\end{figure}

The optimization was performed similar to the ceramic design. Although, since the individual waveplates of this design are based on form birefringent waveplates we also optimized the stratification dimensions $a$ and $b$. To reduce the number of dimensions of the objective function we used the same values of $a$ and $b$ for all waveplates in the design; therefore all individual plates had the same birefringence. However, in the context of this work the main drawback of 3D printing is that the minimum feature size roughly depends on the nozzle diameter of the printer. In our case that was \SI{400}{\micro \meter}, in reality though we could only achieve a minimum feature size of around \SI{700}{\micro \meter} with an air gap width of approximately \SI{300}{\micro \meter}. This means that optimizing the stratification dimensions had no influence on the performance of the final design. Additionally, the variation between the stratification dimensions of the actual print and the design was found to be insignificant. 
Therefore, with a spatial period of around \SI{1}{\milli \meter} and a wavelength of \SI{2.725}{\milli \meter} at \SI{110}{\giga \hertz} we could still almost obtain a $1:3$ ratio considering the condition given in equation \ref{eq:rytov_cond1} that the wavelength should be larger than the stratification period for the approximation of the form birefringence to be reasonable. 

In this case we used the full frequency range since the bandwidth of the GHz setup was fairly narrow. Furthermore, to reduce the run time of the optimization we reduced the frequency resolution to one tenth of the original since the number of 2x2 matrix multiplications for each function evaluation is given by $\frac{Bn}{\Delta \nu}$, where $B$, $n$ and $\Delta \nu$ is the bandwidth, number of individual waveplates and frequency resolution respectively. The objective function itself was similar to $L_{\lambda/4}$, although in equation \ref{eq:l4_loss_function} we changed $r$ to $r^{-1}$. This modification was added in order to investigate if as expected the handedness of the output would then also be inverted compared to the output of the other results based on the original objective function. We subsequently optimized the modified objective function multiple times for $n=1, ..., 5$ and found a design consisting of four plates to be sufficient considering the reduced frequency range. 

\begin{table}[ht]

    \includestandalone[scale=1.0]{images/5_chapter05/polymer_result_table}
    \caption{Design parameters for result 3 obtained through the optimization of $L_{\lambda/4}$ for $n=4$. We used the full bandwidth of the GHz setup for the optimization.}
    \label{tab:res_hips_l4}
\end{table}

The design with the lowest objective function value was chosen as the result of the optimization runs and the design parameters of this design are shown in table \ref{tab:res_hips_l4} and photos of the resulting printed structure are shown in figure \ref{fig:sent2david}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:sent2david}
\end{figure}

Based on the result of the optimization we can again calculate a number of predicted properties of the output and the waveplate. First of all the expected effective refractive indices as well as the absorption coefficients parallel ($n_p$) and perpendicular ($n_s$) to the stratification given $a=\SI{630}{\micro \meter}$, $b=\SI{520}{\micro \meter}$ and the measured refractive index of HIPS are shown in figure \ref{fig:effective_ri_bf_hips}. We see that the expected birefringence is around $0.086$ with a relatively low dispersion although with a slight increase at lower frequencies. Since the effective refractive index is approximately an average of the refractive indices of HIPS and air we see an even lower absorption coefficient compared to the sample consisting of HIPS only. Additionally, the calculated dichroism of the stratified structure is decreasing with increasing frequency. Again, data at the first and last few \si{\giga \hertz} is not reliable due to system artifacts.

    \caption{Calculated effective refractive indices (Left) and absorption coefficient (Right) of stratified HIPS parallel ($n_p$) and perpendicular ($n_s$) to the stratification given $a=\SI{630}{\micro \meter}$, $b=\SI{520}{\micro \meter}$.}
    \label{fig:effective_ri_bf_hips}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:polymer_pe_lp} shows the polarization ellipse representation of the normalized output for a horizontally linearly polarized and LCP input. We see that the output should be almost perfectly RCP as expected in case of a linear input. In case of a LCP input the output is linearly polarized and similarly to the \ce{Al2O3} ceramic designs at different azimuths depending on the frequency. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includestandalone[scale=0.7]{images/5_chapter05/plots/polymer/pe_lp}
    \caption{a) and b) polarization ellipses of the normalized output at different frequencies for horizontally linearly polarized and LCP input respectively.}
    \label{fig:polymer_pe_lp}
\end{figure}

HIPS is almost non-absorbing compared to \ce{Al2O3} ceramic which further means that the transmission losses shown in figure \ref{fig:polymer_intensity} are relatively low considering the fairly thick device thickness of almost \SI{3}{\centi \meter}. The biggest losses are around \SI{80}{\giga \hertz} with a transmission of \SI{1.8}{\decibel}.

    \label{fig:polymer_intensity}
\end{figure}

The circular and linear polarization degrees $V_c$ and $V_l$ are shown in figure \ref{fig:polymer_pol_deg}. $V_c$ is approximately one as expected for RCP light and $V_l$ is in the order of a few percent. We also see that at the edges of the frequency range the waveplate should perform slightly worse compared to other frequencies.
