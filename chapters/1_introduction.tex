The frequency range from around \SI{100}{\giga \hertz} to \SI{24}{\tera \hertz} located midway between microwaves and infrared light is known as the terahertz (THz) frequency range \cite{Jepsen2011}. Electromagnetic (EM) waves in this frequency range have numerous applications not only for fundamental research but also for application in optoelectronic THz systems. The energy of THz photons range from \SI{1}{\milli \electronvolt} to \SI{100}{\milli \electronvolt} which allows probing of physical phenomena such as low-energy excitations in 2D materials \cite{Winnerl2018} and rotational as well as vibrational modes through molecular and time domain spectroscopy \cite{Walther2002, Giesen2005, Baxter2011, Mittleman2003}. In addition, the photon energy is too low to be ionizing which means that spectroscopy utilizing THz radiation preserves the sample of interest and is non hazardous to use \cite{Jepsen2011}.

Due to this increasing number of applications and research based on THz radiation, characterization and control of the field polarization also gained interest especially with the development of waveplates amongst other polarization related components \cite{Castro-Camus2012}. Waveplates and other polarization converters usually depend on the wavelength which is a problem for example in combination with THz time domain spectroscopy due to the usage of broadband radiation and can be a limitation for polarimetry in general. However, designs based on the combination of multiple monochromatic waveplates at different azimuths can be used to realize achromatic waveplates \cite{Wu2020, Masson2006, Ivanov2012, Herrera-Fernandez2015}. In this work we propose and show the experimental demonstration of a similar design which is however based on a single 3D printed structure. With this method production cost and complexity can possibly be reduced. In addition, completely skipping manual assembly has the advantage of reducing angle misalignment errors in theory.

To that extend we introduce THz time domain spectroscopy specifically generation and detection of THz radiation in the first chapter. In the subsequent chapter the three experimental spectroscopy setups which have been used for the measurements in this work are presented. Following, in the third chapter the theoretical fundamentals are described which includes different representations of the polarization state, the underlying optical properties of anisotropic media which are utilized to transform one polarization state into another via waveplates and finally how the Jones calculus can be used to describe the achromatic waveplates. The characterization of the fabricated waveplate design and a discussion thereof is presented in the fifth chapter. A summary with a conclusion as well as an outlook is given in the final chapter.

%For example magnetic fields in the interstellar medium induce polarization due to the Faraday effect which can be characterized using waveplates \cite{Harper2018}.
