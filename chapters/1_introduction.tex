\section{Brief introduction to THz}
On the electromagnetic spectrum, terahertz (THz) refers to electromagnetic waves with photon energies ranging from around 1 to \SI{100}{\milli \electronvolt}. This corresponds to frequencies roughly around \SI{240}{\giga \hertz} for the lower energy photons and \SI{24}{\tera \hertz} for photons with an energy of \SI{100}{\milli \electronvolt}.
