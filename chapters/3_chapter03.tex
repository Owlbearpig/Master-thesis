In this chapter we will introduce the basic principles required to understand what waveplates are and how the most common ones work. Simply put the purpose of a waveplate is to change the polarization of EM waves, most commonly by using a birefringent material. This as well as the underlying physical principles birefringence and dichroism are explained in more detail in the sections \ref{sec:polellipse}, \ref{sec:birefringence} and \ref{sec:waveplates}. Any change to the polarization state caused by the waveplate, and the state itself, can be described mathematically using Jones calculus or almost equivalently using Mueller calculus, which will be shown in section \ref{sec:mathdescription}. Finally, this leads to the description of the waveplate design as it is used in this work as well as the design optimization problem which are presented in the last section (\ref{sec:design}) of this chapter.

\section{The polarization ellipse}
\label{sec:polellipse}
There are several ways to describe the polarization state of EM-waves. One of them is the polarization ellipse which is a geometrical representation of the polarization. This remained the only satisfactory way to visualize the different polarization states for almost the entire 19\textsuperscript{th} century, although it is not very practical for carrying out calculations. At the end of the century another representation was proposed by Henri Poincaré, now known as the Poincaré sphere, which could be used for both calculations and visualization of the polarization states \cite{Collett2008VisualizationSphere}. Poincaré's representation will be explained in section \ref{sec:muellercalc}. The polarization ellipse can be derived either directly from a solution to the EM-wave equation or starting from Maxwell's equations.  It is practical to start from Maxwell's equations, since they are used for derivations later on in this work and almost all equations used originate from them. In differential form Maxwell's equations are given by: 
\par
\noindent\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{align}
    \bm{\nabla}\cdot\bm{D} &=\rho_{f}\;,\label{eq:maxwell1}
    \vphantom{\frac{\partial\bm{B}}{\partial t}}\\
    \bm{\nabla}\cdot\bm{B} &=0\;,\vphantom{\frac{\partial\bm{B}}{\partial t}}\label{eq:maxwell2}
\end{align}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{align}
    \bm{\nabla}\times\bm{E} &=-\frac{\partial\bm{B}}{\partial t}\;,\label{eq:maxwell3}
    \\
    \bm{\nabla}\times\bm{H} &=\bm{J}_f
    +\frac{\partial\bm{D}}{\partial t}\;,\label{eq:maxwell4}
\end{align}
\end{minipage}
\newline

where $\bm{E}, \bm{H}$ denote the electric and magnetizing fields respectively,  $\bm{D}=\hat{\epsilon} \bm{E}$ is the electric displacement, t is the time and $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the permittivity, which depends on the material and is a complex function of the frequency. The materials used in this work are non magnetic, which means that the magnetic and magnetizing fields are proportional: $\bm{B} = \mu_0 \bm{H}$, where $\mu_0$ denotes the vacuum permeability. $\rho_f, \bm{J}_f$ is the free charge and current density respectively. Usually in optics there are no free charge carriers or free currents, which is also the case for all materials in this work, so we set $\rho_f=\bm{J}_f=0$ \cite{Roth2019Optik}. If we then also assume that the materials are homogeneous so that $\hat{\epsilon}$ does not depend on position, then we can reduce equations \ref{eq:maxwell1}-\ref{eq:maxwell4} to the following:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{align}
    \bm{\nabla}\cdot \bm{E} &=0\;,\label{eq:maxwell1reduced}
    \vphantom{\frac{\partial\bm{B}}{\partial t}}\\
    \bm{\nabla}\cdot\bm{B} &=0\;,\vphantom{\frac{\partial\bm{B}}{\partial t}}\label{eq:maxwell2reduced}
\end{align}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{align}
    \bm{\nabla}\times\bm{E} &=-\frac{\partial\bm{B}}{\partial t}\;,\label{eq:maxwell3reduced}
    \\
    \bm{\nabla}\times\bm{B} &=\mu_0 \hat{\epsilon} \frac{\partial\bm{E}}{\partial t}\;,\label{eq:maxwell4reduced}
\end{align}
\end{minipage}
\newline

Applying $\bm{\nabla}\times$ to equation \ref{eq:maxwell3reduced} and with equation \ref{eq:maxwell4reduced} we decouple $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{B}$: 
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\nabla}\times \bm{\nabla}\times \bm{E} = -\mu_0 \hat{\epsilon} \frac{\partial^2\bm{E}}{\partial t^2}
\end{equation}
Then using the vector calculus identity: $\bm{\nabla}\times \bm{\nabla}\times \bm{F} = \bm{\nabla} \left( \bm{\nabla} \cdot \bm{F} \right) - \bm{\nabla}^2 \bm{F}$, for any function $\bm{F}$, together with equation \ref{eq:maxwell1reduced} we get the EM-wave equation: \footnote{We neglect the magnetic field, since we are only concerned with non magnetic materials in this work. But the derivation of the wave equation for the magnetic field would be exactly the same}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:waveeq}
    \bm{\nabla}^2 \bm{E} = \mu_0 \hat{\epsilon} \frac{\partial^2\bm{E}}{\partial t^2}
\end{equation}
and via a Fourier transform $(\partial_t \xrightarrow{\mathscr{F}} i\omega)$ we readily get the Helmholtz equation for $\bm{E}$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:waveeqfreq}
    \bm{\nabla}^2 \bm{E} = -\mu_0 \hat{\epsilon} \omega^2 \bm{E},
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
A solution to the wave equation is a coherent plane wave at frequency $\omega$ which is given by: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:planewave}
    \bm{E} = \bm{E_0} e^{i(\bm{k}\bm{r} - \omega t + \delta)},
\end{equation}
where $\bm{r}$ and $\bm{k}$ denote the position and wave vector respectively, $\bm{E_0}$ denotes the maximum amplitude of the wave and $\delta$ is the phase constant. If we assume the wave propagates along the z-direction in a Cartesian coordinate system, then the amplitude will be orthogonal to the z-direction, i.e a transverse wave. This follows directly from equation \ref{eq:maxwell1reduced}. From the wave equation in frequency space we then find the requirement that the wave number, which is the magnitude of the wave vector, and the angular frequency are related by:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:wavevector_req}
    k = \sqrt{\mu_0 \hat{\epsilon}} \omega
\end{equation}
The phase velocity of the wave can then be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \hat{\epsilon}}} = \frac{c}{\tilde{n}},\:\tilde{n} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\epsilon}}{\epsilon_0}},
\end{equation}
where $c$, $\epsilon_0$ and $n$ is the speed of light in vacuum, vacuum permittivity and refractive index respectively.
So that from the wave equation we get two decoupled wave equations, each describing an oscillation in the x-z plane and the y-z plane. This is also known as Fresnel's wave theory which was proposed and verified experimentally around 1820 by Augustin-Jean Fresnel and François Arago, more than 40 years before Maxwell's equations were published \cite{Collett2009FieldPolarization,Jackson1998ClassicalEdition}.
This means equation \ref{eq:planewave} consists of only two perpendicular components. Additionally, if we consider that Maxwell's equations \ref{eq:maxwell1reduced}-\ref{eq:maxwell4reduced} are all linear and real, then it follows that the real part of any particular solution is also a solution to the wave equation. \footnote{This only works if the equations are real. For example, Schrödinger's equation is linear but complex, therefore even if $\psi$ is a solution $\operatorname{Re}(\psi)$ and $\operatorname{Im}(\psi)$ are not.} We can then write equation \ref{eq:planewave} as two sinusoidal waves:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:plane_wave_realparts}
\begin{aligned}
    E_x(z, t) = E_{0x}\cos(kz-\omega t + \delta_x) \\
    E_y(z, t) = E_{0y}\cos(kz-\omega t + \delta_y), 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_x$ and $\delta_y$ are arbitrary phases of the two components. Depending on the values of $E_{0x}, E_{0y}$ and the relative phase or simply phase, which is $\delta = \delta_y - \delta_x$, we get different polarization states. Figure \ref{fig:Ex_Ey_planewaves} shows the real parts of the two plane wave components for a wave traveling along the z-direction when $\delta=0$ and $E_{0x}=E_{0y}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includestandalone{3_chapter03/tikz_e_wave}
    \caption{This figure shows the two sinusoidal waves given in equation \ref{eq:plane_wave_realparts}, which are the real parts of the plane wave components. Both waves have the same amplitude and phase.}
    \label{fig:Ex_Ey_planewaves}
\end{figure}

From here we can visualize the different polarization states, that is the different directions the electrical field, or simply the light, can oscillate in. If the light is confined to a plane along the direction of propagation it is said to be linearly polarized (LP). An example of this is shown in figure \ref{fig:E_planewave}, where the polarization plane is at an angle of \SI{45}{\degree} relative to the x-axis. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includestandalone[scale=1.1]{3_chapter03/tikz_linear_pol}
    \caption{The black curve shows the superposition of the two sinusoidal waves from equation \ref{eq:plane_wave_realparts}, which is the same as the real part of a LP plane wave at an angle of \SI{45}{\degree} to the x-axis. In addition, the horizontal and the vertical components of the field vector are shown as the red and blue curves respectively.}
    \label{fig:E_planewave}
\end{figure}

Now, if $\delta$ is exactly $\nicefrac{\pi}{2}$ and $E_{0x} = E_{0y}$, then we get the case shown to the right in figure \ref{fig:circ_pol_planewave}. A field with this kind of polarization traces out a circle as time passes for a fixed position in space. On the other hand, if we keep time fixed then the field vector describes a helix along the direction of propagation. This means the field only changes direction but not its magnitude. This type of polarization is therefore called circular polarization (CP). Additionally, because we can trace out a circle in two different directions (clockwise or counterclockwise) we therefore get two different types of circular polarizations. These two types are called right CP (RCP) or left CP (LCP) depending on the direction the circle is traced out, so either in a left- or right-handed sense. This is called the handedness of the light, which can be determined using the right hand rule. For that we fix the right hand at a point on the helix and point the thumb away from the receiver, that is against the direction of propagation. Then the light is right-handed if the helix is traced out in the direction of the other fingers as time revolves, otherwise it is left-handed. The light shown to the left of figure \ref{fig:circ_pol_planewave} is therefore left-handed while the example on the right side of figure \ref{fig:circ_pol_planewave} shows right-handed CP light. The reason why we have two types of CP in the first place, is because of the fact that one component can lead the other, as we can see in figure \ref{fig:circ_pol_planewave}. Where for RCP the horizontal component leads the vertical one by a quarter period ($\delta = -\nicefrac{\pi}{2}$), for LCP it is the other way around and $\delta = \nicefrac{\pi}{2}$.

    \caption{The left figure shows an example of LCP light and the right figure RCP light. Furthermore, handedness originates from one component leading the other. In the case of LCP light the vertical component leads the horizontal component and vice versa for RCP light.}
    \label{fig:circ_pol_planewave}
\end{figure}

Finally, the last polarization state we have not mentioned yet, even though it is in fact the most general, is the elliptical polarization state. The polarization states we have dealt with so far have all been limiting cases of this state. For a fixed position this is fairly simple to visualize geometrically; LP light traces out a line while CP light traces out a circle, both of these shapes are degenerate forms of an ellipse. A summary of the different degenerate states and the corresponding amplitude and phase combinations are shown in table \ref{tab:pol_state_summary}, which is divided into three parts with a pair of states in each. At the top there str the linear horizontal/vertical polarization (LHP/LVP) stated, the linear $\pm\SI{45}{\degree}$ polarization ($L_{\pm45}P$) states are in the middle and the CP states are at the bottom. The last column shows the corresponding degenerate ellipse for each state.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \includestandalone{3_chapter03/pol_summary_table}
    \caption{Summary of the different degenerate polarization states, with corresponding conditions figures. The first four states are linearly polarized at different angles relative to the x-axis; $\SI{0}{\degree}$, $\SI{90}{\degree}$, $\SI{45}{\degree}$ and $\SI{-45}{\degree}$ respectively. The last two are the RCP and LCP states.}
    \label{tab:pol_state_summary}
\end{table}

We can also realize this mathematically by eliminating the time and position dependency of the two components in equation \ref{fig:Ex_Ey_planewaves}, so that we get \footnote{The derivation is given in \ref{sec:deriv_pol_ellipse}}:

\begin{equation}
    \centering
    \frac{1}{\sin^2 \delta} \left[ \left(\frac{E_x}{E_{0x}}\right)^2+\left(\frac{E_y}{E_{0y}}\right)^2-2\frac{E_x E_y}{E_{0x} E_{0y}}\cos \delta \right]=1,
\end{equation}

which describes an ellipse in its nonstandard form. Because of this the equation is called the polarization ellipse. It is worth noting that even though the time and position dependencies have been explicitly eliminated, the wave components $E_x$ and $E_y$ continue to depend on them. That means $E_{0x}$, $E_{0y}$ and $\delta$ are the polarization ellipse parameters, which then define the shape of the ellipse. Therefore, even though the light propagates the shape remains constant. There are several ways to parameterize the polarization ellipse or ellipses in general using two variables. One way is to use the orientation angle $\psi$ and the ellipticity angle $\chi$, which both can be expressed through the polarization ellipse parameters: 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ellipse_orientation}
    \tan 2\psi = \frac{2E_{0x}E_{0y}}{E_{0x}^2 - E_{0y}^2}\cos \delta,\: 0\leqslant\psi\leqslant\pi,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ellipse_ellipticity}
    \sin 2\chi = \frac{2E_{0x}E_{0y}}{E_{0x}^2 + E_{0y}^2}\sin \delta,\: \nicefrac{-\pi}{4}\leqslant\chi\leqslant\nicefrac{\pi}{4}.
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:pol_ellipse} shows an example of a polarization ellipse together with the orientation and ellipticity angles. We see from the figure that for $\psi \rightarrow 0/\pi$ or $\psi \rightarrow \nicefrac{pi}{2}$ the major and minor axes $(a$ and $b)$ coincide with the coordinate axes. Likewise for $\chi \rightarrow 0$ the ellipse degenerates to a line and for $\chi \rightarrow \pm\nicefrac{\pi}{4}$ we get a circle \cite{Collett2009FieldPolarization}. Actually, in most cases a lightbeam is a mixture of different polarization states, this is referred to as unpolarized light. It consists of a high number of short wave trains which are emitted from the individual atoms. In most cases these wave trains are radiated from dipoles and are therefore linearly polarized, but since every atom oscillates in a different direction the polarization will also vary for each wave train. Hence, the beam will be a mixture of different states \cite{Roth2019Optik}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includestandalone{3_chapter03/tikz_pol_ellipse}
    \caption{Example of a polarization ellipse, which shows the ellipticity and orientation angle geometrically. The major and minor axes of the polarization ellipse are denoted by $a$ and $b$ respectively. We see that $\chi$ changes with the shape of the ellipse while $\psi$ is simply the orientation relative to the x-axis.}
    \label{fig:pol_ellipse}
\end{figure}

We finish off this section, as a bit of a side note, by mentioning the conventions used so far. If we go back to the plane wave solution (equation \ref{eq:planewave}) of the wave equation we see that a replacement of $i$ with $-i$ yields another valid linearly independent solution. This leads to two different sets of definitions, depending on the of the imaginary unit. The first one, with a positive sign and the one used here, is commonly used in physics texts. While the other one with a negative sign is mainly used in electrical engineering (EE) texts. Mathematically the difference between these two conventions is simply the direction of rotation of the phasor in the complex plane with increasing time. An example of this is shown for a phasor $x$ in figure \ref{fig:phasor}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includestandalone[scale=1.25]{3_chapter03/tikz_phasor_rotation}
    \caption{Example of a phasor $x$ in the complex plane. The sign of the imaginary unit determines the direction of rotation for increasing times. The rotation is indicated by the blue arrows and is either in the clockwise $(-i)$ or counterclockwise $(+i)$ direction.}
    \label{fig:phasor}
\end{figure}

The choice of sign has other implications. We know from equation \ref{eq:wavevector_req} that the wavevector is in general complex because the permittivity is, so we can write it as $k=\beta + i \alpha$. On the other hand we get two expressions for a plane wave propagating in the z-direction, one for each definition:
\begin{align}
    &\bm{E_{0}}e^{i((\beta + i \alpha)z-\omega t + \delta)} \\
    &\bm{E_{0}}e^{-i((\beta + i \alpha)z-\omega t + \delta)}, 
\end{align}
if we factor out the $\alpha$ dependency we get:
\begin{align}
    e^{-\alpha z}&\bm{E_{0}}e^{i(\beta z-\omega t + \delta)} \\
    e^{\alpha z}&\bm{E_{0}}e^{-i(\beta z-\omega t + \delta)}. 
\end{align}
We see that in case of the EE definition the amplitude would increase as the wave propagates, which is nonsense.\footnote{This problem also arises in the derivation of the Lorentz oscillator model. More about this in the appendix (section \ref{sec:lorentz_model_sign}), since it is out of scope of this work.} Therefore the sign of the imaginary part of the wavevector must be chosen accordingly. So for the EE definition we get:
\begin{equation}
    k=\beta - i \alpha
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    k=\beta + i \alpha
\end{equation}
for the physics definition.
As a result the sign of the imaginary part of the refractive index will also depend on the chosen definition. When the EE definition is used:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{n}= n - i \kappa
\end{equation}
and using the physics definition:  
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{n}= n + i \kappa
\end{equation}

The physics definition is used for example in the textbooks by John D. Jackson \cite{Jackson1998ClassicalEdition} and David J. Griffiths \cite{Griffiths2017IntroductionElectrodynamics} and also in \cite{Collett2009FieldPolarization}, which is the reference used for most of this section.
There are not only convention differences between engineers and physicists but also even between different branches of physics. The definition of CP handedness relies on the point of view; that is either looking from the source in the direction of propagation or from the receiver against the direction of propagation. Here we use the version which is defined from the point of view of the receiver. This is also the convention commonly used in optics \cite{Bass2016HandbookOptics, M.LandiDeglInnocenti2004PolarizationLines} as well as by SPIE \cite{Collett2009FieldPolarization}.
The other convention is used by radio astronomers \cite{1973CommissionAstronomie}, quantum physicists, because it is consistent with the convention of handedness for a particle's spin and it is also used by electrical engineers \cite{Orfanidis2004ElectromagneticAntennas}.

\section{Modifying the polarization state}
In the previous section we saw that the electrical field consists of two perpendicular components which trace out an ellipse as time propagates for any fixed position. Additionally, the shape and orientation of the ellipse depends on the relative phase of the two components as well as their amplitudes. Naturally this dependency is symmetrical in the two amplitudes and the relative phase, as can be seen directly from equations \ref{eq:ellipse_orientation} and \ref{eq:ellipse_ellipticity}. Therefore in order to change the polarization state, the change in each of the individual phases must be different and or that of the two amplitudes. Otherwise simply the scale of the ellipse would change and not its shape or orientation. Consequently, for this to happen the medium the wave is propagating in must be anisotropic. Now, if the absorption of the material is direction dependent, then the amplitude will vary differently for the two components. Materials with this property are said to be dichroic. Likewise, some materials cause different phase changes between the two components. This material property is called birefringence. In the following section we will explain these two properties phenomenologically as well as their underlying physical principle.
-TODO Add E perp to K and B etc. in beginning of maxwell stuff...
-TODO maybe add small note about why dealing with single frequency makes sense -> fft, superposition principle stuff (griffiths explains it 7.12 or something)
-indexellipsoid.

\subsection{Dichroism}
\label{sec:dichroism}
In general, the term dichroism refers to the selective absorption of one of the two perpendicular field components of the light. Materials with this property are said to be dichroic. This can be used in for example polarizers, which are extremely anisotropic so that one component is almost completely extinguished by the polarizer, while it is transparent to the other field component. The simplest polarizer of this sort is a grid of parallel conducting wires as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:wire_grid_polarizer} which is also known as a wire grid polarizer (WGP). The WGP is similar to a conducting diffraction grating with a sub-wavelength period. Now, if we assume that the light initially is unpolarized as it propagates towards the wire grid from the left, then the light will be linearly polarized perpendicular to the wires after the WGP. We can see this by considering the interaction of the two field components with the wires separately. One component can then be set to be parallel to the wires and the other perpendicular. The electrons are free to move in the y-direction, because the wires are conducting, so that a current is generated due to the acceleration of the electrons by the parallel field component. This current results in joule heating of the wires so that a part of the energy of the electric field is turned into heat. Additionally, the accelerated electrons radiate in both the forward and backward directions. The part that is radiated forwards, along the direction of propagation, mostly cancels the transmitted incident wave and the other part appears as the reflected wave. On the other hand, the electrons along the x-direction, that is perpendicular to the wires, are not free to move very far so that the corresponding wave component passes almost freely. So, at the end the component parallel to the wires is mostly extinguished and the light is therefore linearly polarized perpendicular to the wires \cite{HechtOpticsEdition}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includestandalone[scale=1.20]{3_chapter03/tikz_wire_grid_polarizer}
    \caption{This figure shows a wire grid polarizer which is essentially a conducting sub-wavelength grating. From the left unpolarized light interacts with the wire grid so that the field components parallel to the wires are eliminated. After passing the polarizer the light is therefore linearly polarized perpendicular to the wires.}
    \label{fig:wire_grid_polarizer}
\end{figure}

It has been shown that it is possible to polarize even visible light using these wire grids. In 1960 George R. Bird and Maxfield Parrish fabricated a WGP having 2160 wires per mm, making it suitable for Near-Infrared light \cite{Bird1960ThePolarizer}. Naturally, WGPs also exist for the lower THz-range. An example of this is an aluminum-based WGP whith a frequency range of \SIrange{0.3}{2.5}{\tera \hertz} and an extinction ratio ranging from \SI{45}{\dB} for lower frequencies and \SI{30}{\dB} for the higher ones. The extinction ratio is simply the ratio of the transmitted power coefficients for the field components perpendicular and parallel to the wires in decibel, so it is a measure of how well the light is only transmitted perpendicular to the wires after passing the polarizer \cite{Ferraro2016FlexibleLoss}. 
In contrast to a WGP some materials are inherently dichroic. For example the mineral tourmaline has a specific axis, which in general is called the optic axis. Light propagating parallel to this axis experiences a smaller absorption coefficient compared to any other direction. Additionally, this selective absorption depends on the wavelength of the light. Therefore if the crystal is illuminated with white polarized light, then the absorbed colors will change depending on the polarization and so the crystal will change color depending on the polarization. This is where the name dichroic comes from, meaning two colors. The mechanism that gives rise to dichroism in crystals can be explained by considering its microscopic structure. The electrons bound to the lattice points of the crystal interact with electrons bound to other nuclei, especially the nearest neighbors. So if the crystal lattice is asymmetrical then the binding forces of the electrons will also be asymmetrical resulting in a polarization dependent response. Additionally, if the conductivity depends on the direction so will the amount of joule heating generated due to the induced currents. As a consequence the absorption will be direction dependent \cite{HechtOpticsEdition}.

\subsection{Birefringence}
\label{sec:birefringence}
Birefringence is the material property responsible for the phenomenon of double refraction. This phenomenon was observed for the first time in calcite crystals by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669 \cite{RasmusBartholin1669ExperimentaDetegitur, Restaino2015PolarizationDevices}. The effect of double refraction on a light beam passing through a birefringent material is relatively easy to show. One can simply place a birefringent crystal on top of some text, as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:3birefringence}. Two images of the text become visible through the crystal and each image is shifted by a different amount. These images are not simply reflections at the crystal-air interface, since the images are brighter compared to images formed through reflections, and they are even visible when looking down directly from above. Also if the crystal is rotated then one of the images will be stationary, while the other one will circle around the stationary image. The rays forming the stationary image are known as the ordinary rays (o-rays), while the ones forming the moving image are called extraordinary rays (e-rays) as suggested by Bartholin at the discovery of the phenomena. The same effect can be illustrated by sending an unpolarized laser beam through the crystal. The beam is split in two as it propagates through the crystal. One can show, using a WGP or any other polarizer, that the polarization states of the two beams are orthogonal \cite{Roth2019Optik}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/3_chapter03/birefringence.png}
    \caption{A calcite crystal placed on top of some text. This demonstrates the effect of birefringence on the original image seen through the crystal \cite{Roth2019Optik}.}
    \label{fig:3birefringence}
\end{figure}

The explanation of the underlying physical principle of birefringence is similar to that of dichroism; it can be explained by considering the structure of the material. We can represent the binding of the electron cloud to the nuclei at each crystal lattice point using a harmonic oscillator model. The model, which is shown in figure \ref{fig:electron_shell}, consists of a shell bound to the nuclei with springs. Furthermore, the springs have different spring constants and the nuclei is fixed in space. So, if an electron is displaced parallel to one of the springs it will oscillate with a different frequency relative to any other direction. How this finally influences the refractive index can be explained by considering the propagation of light through a transparent medium. As the wave propagates through the medium the electrical field excites the electrons which in turn reradiate. These reradiated wavelets recombine to form the refracted wave. Additionally, the phase velocity of the refracted wave will be determined by the frequency difference between the natural oscillation of the electrons and the frequency of the electrical field. Since the refractive index is simply the ratio between the speed of light in vacuum and in the medium it will change too depending on this frequency difference. If we go back to figure \ref{fig:electron_shell} this means that for example a wave linearly polarized parallel to the x-axis experiences a different refractive index compared to one polarized parallel to the z-axis. That is also the definition of birefringence; a material with two or more different refractive indices. Another related and important concept is the optic axis of a crystal\footnote{In the context of crystals it is called the optic axis, otherwise it is called the optical axis like the axis perpendicular to the center of a lens \cite{HechtOpticsEdition}.}. That is, if we have the case in which two springs have the same rigidity, for example those in the xy-plane, then the optic axis will be parallel to the z-axis. The special property of the optic axis is that any wave propagating parallel to it will not undergo any birefringence effects, because the material is optically symmetrical under any rotation about this axis. Therefore the two components of the wave, which are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation, will experience the same refractive index. Since this symmetry exists at every lattice point, the optic axis is actually a direction and not just a line through a single point \cite{HechtOpticsEdition}.

    \caption{Mechanical model of an electron cloud, which is represented by a spherical shell. It is bound to its nucleus via springs of different strength. The nucleus is fixed in space. This model is a simplification of an optical anisotropic material, for an isotropic material the spring constants would be equal. Calculating the refractive index for a specific crystal uses a quantum mechanical description as it is done in for example \cite{Rerat2020FromApproach}.}

Furthermore, this explains the phenomena described at the beginning of this section. Going back to the calcite crystal shown in figure \ref{fig:3birefringence} we see that the optic axis must be at an angle, not parallel or perpendicular, to the surface normal. Otherwise we would not observe double refraction. Additionally, the field components perpendicular to the optic axis will not be refracted and therefore form the o-rays, which makes the image look like it is seen through an ordinary piece of glass. The other field components will have a part parallel to the optic axis and one perpendicular to it. This means that the wavefront gets distorted and that part is therefore refracted. Those refracted parts then form the e-rays. Finally, this also explains why the polarizations states of the o- and e-rays are orthogonal because of the spatial separation of the two field components. For clarity a sketch of the field, as it passes through the calcite crystal, is shown in figure \ref{fig:calcite_beams}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includestandalone[scale=1.2]{3_chapter03/tikz_calcite_beams}
    \caption{The field components are separated as the light passes through the calcite crystal forming the e- and o-ray. The component perpendicular to the optic axis passes through as expected for normal incidence, while the other component is refracted. This also means the polarization states of the two rays are orthogonal.}
