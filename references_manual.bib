Thus, it has found increasing application in both backscattering imaging of bulk tissue samples and transmission microscopic imaging of thin tissue slices. Recently, we proposed a technique to transform the 4 × 4 Mueller matrix elements into a group of parameters, which have explicit associations with specific microstructural features of samples. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the relationships between the Mueller matrix transformation parameters and the characteristic microstructures of tissues by using experimental phantoms and Monte Carlo simulations based on different tissue mimicking models. We also adopt quantitative evaluation indicators to compare the Mueller matrix transformation parameters with the Mueller matrix polar decomposition parameters. The preliminary imaging results of bulk porcine colon tissues and thin human pathological tissue slices demonstrate the potential of Mueller matrix transformation parameters as biomedical diagnostic indicators. Also, this study provides quantitative criteria for parameter selection in biomedical Mueller matrix imaging.},

abstract = {This book provides a broad and applications-oriented introduction to electromagnetic waves and antennas. Current interest in these areas is driven by the growth in wireless and fiber-optic communications, information technology, and materials science. Communications, antenna, radar, and microwave engineers must deal with the generation, transmission, and reception of electromagnetic waves. Device engineers working on ever-smaller integrated circuits and at ever higher frequencies must take into account wave propagation effects at the chip and circuit-board levels. Communication and computer network engineers routinely use waveguiding systems, such as transmission lines and optical fibers. Novel recent developments in materials, such as photonic bandgap structures, omnidirectional dielectric mirrors, birefringent multilayer films, surface plasmons, negative-index metamaterials, slow and fast light, promise a revolution in the control and manipulation of light and other applications. These are just some examples of topics discussed in this book. The book is organized around three main topic areas: The propagation, reflection, and transmission of plane waves, and the analysis and design of multilayer films. Waveguides, transmission lines, impedance matching, and S-parameters. Linear and aperture antennas, scalar and vector diffraction theory, antenna array design, and coupled antennas. The text emphasizes connections to other subjects. For example, the mathematical techniques for analyzing wave propagation in multilayer structures, multisegment transmission lines, and the design of multilayer optical filters are the same as those used in DSP, such as the lattice structures of linear prediction, the analysis and synthesis of speech, and geophysical signal processing. Similarly, antenna array design is related to the problem of spectral analysis of sinusoids and to digital filter design, and Butler beams are equivalent to the FFT.},

The Jones matrix of thermally treated porcine tendon showed a reduction of birefringence from thermal damage. The Jones matrices of porcine skin and bovine cartilage also revealed that the density and orientation of the collagen fibers in porcine skin and bovine cartilage are not distributed as uniformly as in porcine tendon.

abstract = {While the concept of focusing usually applies to the spatial domain, it is equally applicable to the time domain. Real-time imaging of temporal focusing of single ultrashort laser pulses is of great significance in exploring the physics of the space–time duality and finding diverse applications. The drastic changes in the width and intensity of an ultrashort laser pulse during temporal focusing impose a requirement for femtosecond-level exposure to capture the instantaneous light patterns generated in this exquisite phenomenon. Thus far, established ultrafast imaging techniques either struggle to reach the desired exposure time or require repeatable measurements. We have developed single-shot 10-trillion-frame-per-second compressed ultrafast photography (T-CUP), which passively captures dynamic events with 100-fs frame intervals in a single camera exposure. The synergy between compressed sensing and the Radon transformation empowers T-CUP to significantly reduce the number of projections needed for reconstructing a high-quality three-dimensional spatiotemporal datacube. As the only currently available real-time, passive imaging modality with a femtosecond exposure time, T-CUP was used to record the first-ever movie of non-repeatable temporal focusing of a single ultrashort laser pulse in a dynamic scattering medium. T-CUP's unprecedented ability to clearly reveal the complex evolution in the shape, intensity, and width of a temporally focused pulse in a single measurement paves the way for single-shot characterization of ultrashort pulses, experimental investigation of nonlinear light-matter interactions, and real-time wavefront engineering for deep-tissue light focusing.},

abstract = {Summary Starting from the classical oscillator model of an atom, this chapter obtains some of the most important formulas used to describe the absorption and emission of light. It went beyond the classical oscillator model by introducing the oscillator strength and the fact that absorption and emission involve transitions between allowed energy levels. We showed that the thermal radiation spectrum implies that there must be stimulated emission as well as spontaneous emission and absorption. Thermal radiation is broadband in the sense that its spectrum is much broader than the lineshape function of the atoms with which it is in equilibrium. In the opposite, narrowband limit of interest for lasers, the rates are proportional to the atomic lineshape function S (n), where S (n) is a Lorentzian function in the collision-broadening limit. The formulas obtained for the absorption or gain coefficient will be central to much of the discussion of laser theory.

The desired range of achromatism determines the optimum values of 2$\delta$1 and c (which, in turn, will determine the orientation of the effective principal planes of the combination). As an example, using mica retardation plates prepared for Hg 5461, the range from 4100 {\AA} to 6800 {\AA} is covered with 2$\delta$1 = 115° 42′ and c = 69° 54′. Further, for a particular wave-length, a birefringent compensator of variable retardation (0 to 2$\pi$) is obtained by interposing a half-wave plate that can be rotated in its own plane, between two quarter-wave plates that have their fast vibration directions parallel.

The coordinates of a point W̄ representing the polarization state are shown to be simply related to the Stokes parameters. The center of the sphere represents a completely unpolarized wave, and the degree of polarization is given by the distance of the point W̄ from the center of the sphere.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Optical Society of America. In this paper, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the inverse polarization effect in three-dimensional (3-D) printed polarizers for the frequency range of 0.5 - 2.7 THz. The polarizers simply consist of 3-D printed strip lines of conductive polylactic acid (CPLA, Proto-Pasta) and do not require a substrate or any further metallic deposition. The experimental and numerical results show that the proposed structure acts as a broadband polarizer between the range of 0.3 THz to 2.7 THz, in which the inverse polarization effect is clearly seen for frequencies above 0.5 THz. In the inverse polarization effect, the transmission of the transverse electric (TE) component exceeds that of the TM component, in contrast to the behavior of a typical wire-grid polarizer. We show how the performance of the polarizers depends on the spacing and thickness of the CPLA structure; extinction ratios higher than 20 dB are achieved. This is the first report using CPLA to fabricate THz polarizers, demonstrating the potential of using conductive polymers to design THz components efficiently and robustly.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

By physically realizable, we mean that 0≤g≤1 where g ≡ (output intensity/input intensity). Using the singular-value decomposition of an arbitrary 2 × 2 complex-valued matrix, we prove that a Jones matrix TJ is physically realizable if 0 ≤ det (Formula Presented) ≤ 1. Consequently singular Jones matrices (i.e. det TJ =0) completely extinguish the output intensity irrespective of the input intensity because g≡0. Corresponding results are obtained for Mueller-Jones matrices (the 4 × 4 real-valued matrices which are the four-dimensional representations of the two-dimensional 2 × 2 complex-valued Jones matrices). We also study the problem for general Mueller matrices; however because of their phenomenological character they do not admit of such criteria as do the Jones and Mueller-Jones matrices. This is because g now depends upon the matrix elements of the Mueller matrix and the input Stokes parameters; whereas for the Jones and Mueller–Jones matrices, g only depends upon the matrix elements. Finally we study the problem of relating the input and output mean randomness. {\textcopyright} 1987 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

To overcome the unavoidable decoherence in a noisy channel, to date, many efforts have been made to transmit one state by consuming large numbers of time-synchronized ancilla states. However, such huge demands of quantum resources are hard to meet with current technology and this restricts practical applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate quantum error detection, an economical approach to reliably protecting a qubit against bit-flip errors. Arbitrary unknown polarization states of single photons and entangled photons are converted into time bins deterministically via a modified Franson interferometer. Noise arising in both 10ĝ€...m and 0.8ĝ€...km fiber, which induces associated errors on the reference frame of time bins, is filtered when photons are detected. The demonstrated resource efficiency and state independence make this protocol a promising candidate for implementing a real-world quantum communication network.},

There were several instances of sign confusion in the problem sets and lecture notes, so we apologize for the confusion and will attempt to clarify the issue. There is actually a difference between physics texts (dealing with general EM, lasers, and all sorts of atomic radiation interactions) and electrical engineering (EE) texts (mostly dealing with antenna theory, where electrical engineers have historically been most prevalent in encountering radiation) in the various definitions of complex dielectric function, complex index of refraction, etc. For example, in physics texts, you'll see the complex index of refraction listed as: {\~{n}} = n + i$\kappa$ However, in electrical engineering texts (such as the 6.013 course notes), you'll see the index of refraction listed as: {\~{n}} = n − j$\kappa$ Evidently, from these two treatments, it seems that i = −j. This is somewhat true in a bizarre way, at least for EM phasor terminology, which we'll elucidate below. BUT, this is not a hard and fast convention. Some texts may confuse the two uses, using i and j interchangeably, so we'll show you how to consistently handle signs. The confusion comes from the initial choice of phasor rotation direction with increasing time, which ultimately decides all the signs in the system.},

abstract = {Polarization measurements have become nearly indispensible in lidar cloud and aerosol studies. Despite polarization's widespread use in lidar, its theoretical description has been widely varying in accuracy and completeness. Incomplete polarization lidar descriptions invariably result in poor accountability for scatterer properties and instrument effects, reducing data accuracy and disallowing the intercomparison of polarization lidar data between different systems. We introduce here the Stokes vector lidar equation, which is a full description of polarization in lidar from laser output to detector. We then interpret this theoretical description in the context of forward polar decomposition of Mueller matrices where distinct polarization attributes of diattenuation, retardance, and depolarization are elucidated. This decomposition can be applied to scattering matrices, where volumes consisting of randomly oriented particles are strictly depolarizing, while oriented ice crystals can be diattenuating, retarding, and depolarizing. For instrument effects we provide a description of how different polarization attributes will impact lidar measurements. This includes coupling effects due to retarding and depolarization attributes of the receiver, which have no description in scalar representations of polarization lidar. We also describe how the effects of polarizance in the receiver can result in nonorthogonal polarization detection channels. This violates one of the most common assumptions in polarization lidar operation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Optical Society of America.},

To achieve broadband and ultra-broadband performance, the authors utilized the relative rotation between the individual identical half-wave plates as control parameters, thus simulating the well-known control technique of composite pulses from quantum optics. In this paper, we extend the broadband and ultra-broadband designs by relaxing the condition of having identical constituent half-wave plates and allow for their thicknesses to also be variable control parameters. We further relax the condition of having symmetric rotation angles and solve numerically for both control parameters - rotation angles and thicknesses of the birefringent plates. We show that the presented design is broadband over a much wider range of the wavelengths, compared to the original design, when using the same number of constituent half-wave plates.},

abstract = {A detailed analysis of the polarization effects which lead to nonlinearity in the non-ideal optical heterodyne interferometer is presented. Extensive use is made of the coherency matrix representation by setting up a 'cross-coherency matrix' representation. A generalized treatment of periodic phase errors (nonlinearity) is then presented. Individual contributions to the nonlinearity have been characterized as either `independent' or `dependent' phase errors. In the single-pass plane-mirror heterodyne system, to which the approach is applied, phase errors for rotational misalignment of the nominally orthogonal linearly polarized input states, beam splitter leakage, non-orthogonality, ellipticity and the effect of misaligned polarizer-mixer are explicitly considered. The latter effect is found to produce nonlinearity only when in combination with any one of the first three and is therefore a dependent phase error. The nonlinearity arising from ellipticity is identical with that from rotational misalignment except that it has an offset. Rotational misalignment and ellipticity produce nonlinearity at the second harmonic and are second order for practical set-ups. It is also found that combinations of positive (anticlockwise) and negative (clockwise) angular misalignments of the azimuth of the states, non-orthogonality and misorientations of the polarizer-mixer, all relative to the polarizing beam splitter axes, lead to different peak-to-peak nonlinearities in the given system. {\textcopyright} 1995 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

In this work, we identify a solution to circumvent this conventional design procedure by means of a deep learning architecture. When fed an input set of customer-defined optical spectra, the constructed generative network generates candidate patterns that match the on-demand spectra with high fidelity.

Polarization elements, and Jones matrices as well, are divided into two classes: homogeneous, with orthogonal eigenpolarizations, and inhomogeneous, with nonorthogonal eigenpolarizations. The basic polarization properties, diattenuation and retardance, of homogeneous polarization elements are straightforward and well known; these elements are characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenpolarizations. Polarization properties of inhomogeneous polarization elements are not so evident. By applying polar decomposition, the definitions of diattenuation and retardance are generalized to inhomogeneous polarization elements, providing an understanding of their polarization characteristics. Furthermore, an inhomogeneity parameter is introduced to describe the degree of inhomogeneity in a polarization element. These results are then adapted to degenerate polarization elements, which have only one linearly independent eigenpolarization.},

Whilst there have been many theoretical models predicting structural and electrical organization of the electrochemical double layer, the experimental verification of these models has been challenging due to the limitations of available experimental techniques. The induced potential drop in the electrolyte has never been directly observed and verified experimentally, to the best of our knowledge. In this study, we report the direct probing of the potential drop as well as the potential of zero charge by means of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed under polarization conditions. By analyzing the spectra of the solvent (water) and a spectator neutral molecule with numerical simulations of the electric field, we discern the shape of the electrochemical double layer profile. In addition, we determine how the electrochemical double layer changes as a function of both the electrolyte concentration and applied potential.},

By physically realizable, we mean that 0≤g≤1 where g ≡ (output intensity/input intensity). Using the singular-value decomposition of an arbitrary 2 × 2 complex-valued matrix, we prove that a Jones matrix TJ is physically realizable if 0 ≤ det (Formula Presented) ≤ 1. Consequently singular Jones matrices (i.e. det TJ =0) completely extinguish the output intensity irrespective of the input intensity because g≡0. Corresponding results are obtained for Mueller-Jones matrices (the 4 × 4 real-valued matrices which are the four-dimensional representations of the two-dimensional 2 × 2 complex-valued Jones matrices). We also study the problem for general Mueller matrices; however because of their phenomenological character they do not admit of such criteria as do the Jones and Mueller-Jones matrices. This is because g now depends upon the matrix elements of the Mueller matrix and the input Stokes parameters; whereas for the Jones and Mueller–Jones matrices, g only depends upon the matrix elements. Finally we study the problem of relating the input and output mean randomness. {\textcopyright} 1987 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

abstract = {Composite waveplates (CWs) consisting of multiple single waveplates are basic polarization elements and widely used to manipulate the polarized light in optical systems, and their performances affect the final accuracy and precision significantly. This research proposes a method for the comprehensive characterization of an arbitrary CW based on spectroscopic Mueller matrix polarimetry. An analytical model is established to describe a general CW by extending Jones' equivalent theorem with Mueller matrix calculus. In this model, an arbitrary CW is optically equivalent to a cascaded system consisting of a linear retarder with slight diattenuation followed by an optical rotator, and its polarization properties are completely described by four polarization parameters, including the retardance, the fast axis azimuth, the rotation angle, and the diattenuation angle. Analytical relations between the polarization properties, the structure, and the Mueller matrix of the CW are then derived from the established model. By the proposed method, the polarization parameters of an arbitrary CW can be comprehensively characterized over an ultra-wide spectral range via only one measurement. Moreover, the actual structure of the CW, including the thicknesses and fast axis azimuths of the single waveplates, as well as the axis alignment errors, can be completely reconstructed from the polarization spectra. Experiments performed with a house-developed broadband Mueller matrix polarimeter on three typical CWs including a compound zero-order waveplate, an achromatic waveplate and a specially designed biplate have demonstrated the capability of the proposed method.Polarization errors associated with zero-order achromatic quarter-wave plates in the whole visible spectral range," Opt.

power and energy supply. In this work, activated carbon derived from fluid coke as a
brand new material was studied for its potential as an electrode material due to its high
specific surface area (SSA) and large portion of mesopores. A suitable electrode material
formula (AC:TR:PTFE=90:6:4wt{\%}),current collector, counter electrode, and cell
configuration were investigated to fabricate a testable system and ensure the
reproducibility of measurements. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current
charge/discharge (CD) techniques were used to characterize the performance of the
electrode material, as well as to study its fundamental behaviour. A new procedure was
established for quantifying the capacitance (Cc) of EDLC from CV which isolates the
effect of internal resistance on the measured capacitance (CM) and creates a capacitance
profile to better understand the performance of the capacitor cell during the
charge/discharge process. The specific capacitance of single electrode made of activated
carbon ({\~{}}1900 m2/g) with approximately 80{\%} mesopores and macropores was able to

abstract = {For in vivo determination of optically active (chiral) substances in turbid media, like for example glucose in human tissue, the backscattering geometry is particularly convenient. However, recent polarimetric measurements performed in the backscattering geometry have shown that, in this geometry, the relatively small rotation of the polarization vector arising due to the optical activity of the medium is totally swamped by the much larger changes in the orientation angle of the polarization vector due to scattering. We show that the change in the orientation angle of the polarization vector arises due to the combined effect of linear diattenuation and linear retardance of light scattered at large angles and can be decoupled from the pure optical rotation component using polar decomposition of Mueller matrix. For this purpose, the method developed earlier for polar decomposition of Mueller matrix was extended to incorporate optical rotation in the medium. The validity of this approach for accurate determination of the degree of optical rotation using the Mueller matrix measured from the medium in both forward and backscattering geometry was tested by conducting studies on chiral turbid samples prepared using known concentration of scatterers and glucose molecules. {\textcopyright} 2006 Optical Society of America.},

In this paper, we show that the BH framework is general and versatile, allowing to address problems related to the characterization of protein structure, assembly, and motion due to its fundamental ability to sample minima in a high-dimensional variable space. We show how specific implementations of the main components in BH yield algorithmic realizations that attain state-of-the-art results in the context of ab initio protein structure prediction and rigid protein-protein docking. We also show that BH can map intermediate minima related with motions connecting diverse stable functionally relevant states in a protein molecule, thus serving as a first step towards the characterization of transition trajectories connecting these states.},

abstract = {The field of high energy physics aims to discover the underlying structure of matter by searching for and studying exotic particles, such as the top quark and Higgs boson, produced in collisions at modern accelerators. Since such accelerators are extraordinarily expensive, extracting maximal information from the resulting data is essential. However, most accelerator events do not produce particles of interest, so making effective measurements requires event selection, in which events producing particles of interest (signal) are separated from events producing other particles (background). This article studies the use of machine learning to aid event selection. First, we apply supervised learning methods, which have succeeded previously in similar tasks. However, they are suboptimal in this case because they assume that the selector with the highest classification accuracy will yield the best final analysis; this is not true in practice, as such analyses are more sensitive to some backgrounds than others. Second, we present a new approach that uses stochastic optimization techniques to directly search for selectors that maximize either the precision of top quark mass measurements or the sensitivity to the presence of the Higgs boson. Empirical results confirm that stochastically optimized selectors result in substantially better analyses. We also describe a case study in which the best selector is applied to real data from the Fermilab Tevatron accelerator, resulting in the most precise top quark mass measurement of this type to date. Hence, this new approach to event selection has already contributed to our knowledge of the top quark's mass and our understanding of the larger questions upon which it sheds light. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In our experiment, we are able to change the quantum state of the emerging photon from a pure state to a fully mixed state without any direct interaction with the photon. Although most lowest-order interference experiments can be explained by classical theory, our experiment has no genuine classical analog.

However, and perhaps due to this colloquial understanding, specific measurements on the curse of dimensionality and its effects are not as extensive. In continuous domains, the volume of the search space grows exponentially with dimensionality. Conversely, the number of function evaluations budgeted to explore this search space usually grows only linearly. The divergence of these growth rates has important effects on the parameters used in particle swarm optimization and differential evolution as dimensionality increases. New experiments focus on the effects of population size and key changes to the search characteristics of these popular metaheuristics when population size is less than the dimensionality of the search space.

abstract = {We summarize the problem of measuring an ultrashort laser pulse and describe in detail a technique that completely characterizes a pulse in time: frequency-resolved optical gating. Emphasis is placed on the choice of experimental beam geometry and the implementation of the iterative phase-retrieval algorithm that together yield an accurate measurement of the pulse time-dependent intensity and phase over a wide range of circumstances. We compare several commonly used beam geometries, displaying sample traces for each and showing where each is appropriate, and we give a detailed description of the pulse-retrieval algorithm for each of these cases. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics. S0034-67489700209-8 I. THE PROBLEM OF MEASURING AN ULTRASHORT LASER PULSE The past decade has seen tremendous progress in the development of lasers that emit ultrashort pulses. 1-4 Light pulses are approaching durations of a single optical cycle-one to two femtoseconds (10 15 s) for visible and near-IR wavelengths. And, in addition, the use of ultrashort pulses for both fundamental studies and applications is increasing rapidly. 5-8 As these pulses shrink in length and grow in utility, the ability to measure them becomes increasingly important. There are several reasons for this. First, precise knowledge of the pulse properties is necessary for verifying theoretical models of pulse creation. 9,10 Second, in order to make even shorter pulses, it is necessary to understand the distortions that limit the length of currently available pulses. 9,10 Third, in experiments using these pulses, it is always important to know at least the pulse length in order to determine the temporal resolution of a given experiment. Moreover, in many experiments-studies of molecular vibrations, for example-additional details of the pulse's structure play an important role in determining the outcome of the experiment. Of particular importance is the variation of frequency during the pulse, known as ''chirp.'' For example, chirped pulses can cause much greater molecular photodissociation than un-chirped pulses. 6 Fourth, a new class of material-characterization techniques is now evolving that depends heavily on the ability to precisely characterize an ultrashort pulse experimentally. More detailed material information can be discerned by fully characterizing the input and output pulses in such methods. 11,12 Finally, numerous applications have emerged for shaped ultrashort pulses, 13,14 and, of course, it is necessary to be able to measure the shape of the pulse used in these measurements. Fortunately, in the past five years, remarkable progress has occurred in the development of techniques for the measurement of ultrashort laser pulses. It is now routine to completely characterize the time dependence of these pulses in the laboratory. 15-20 With the most commonly used new pulse-measurement method, frequency-resolved optical gat-ing, FROG, 16-18,21-34 it is now possible to measure pulses over a wide range of wavelengths, pulse lengths, and complexities and to do so in a manner that is general, robust, accurate, and rigorous. Single-shot measurement is straightforward. 21,24,31 FROG measurements are insensitive to noise. 28,35 Feedback regarding the quality of the data virtually eliminates the possibility that systematic error could cause one pulse to mimic another. 23,32,34 Indeed, internal consistency checks in FROG even allow the correction of a trace for many types of systematic error, even when the sources of the error is unknown. 34 Complex apparatus is not necessary; FROG simply involves spectrally resolving the signal beam of an autocorrelation measurement. As most ultrafast laboratories already possess an autocorrelator and spectrometer for pulse measurement, complete pulse measurement using FROG requires no new apparatus. Finally, it is also possible to measure very weak pulses: combining FROG with spectral interferometry allows full characterization of a pulse train containing less than one photon per pulse on average. 18 What does full characterization mean? The pulse is defined by its electric field as a function of time, E(t). For the sake of simplicity, we treat the field as linearly polarized and therefore consider only the scalar component of it. We also assume that the pulse separates into the product of spatial and temporal factors, and we neglect the spatial factor. We will discuss the spatiotemporal measurement of a pulse later. The time-dependent component of the pulse can be written: Et ReI t expi 0 tit , 1 3277 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 68 (9),},

abstract = {Oh, the signs! You may have already encountered some confusion regarding the signs in your homework regarding dissipation of electromagnetic waves. There were several instances of sign confusion in the problem sets and lecture notes, so we apologize for the confusion and will attempt to clarify the issue. There is actually a difference between physics texts (dealing with general EM, lasers, and all sorts of atomic radiation interactions) and electrical engineering (EE) texts (mostly dealing with antenna theory, where electrical engineers have historically been most prevalent in encountering radiation) in the various definitions of complex dielectric function, complex index of refraction, etc. For example, in physics texts, you'll see the complex index of refraction listed as: {\~{n}} = n + i$\kappa$ However, in electrical engineering texts (such as the 6.013 course notes), you'll see the index of refraction listed as: {\~{n}} = n − j$\kappa$ Evidently, from these two treatments, it seems that i = −j. This is somewhat true in a bizarre way, at least for EM phasor terminology, which we'll elucidate below. BUT, this is not a hard and fast convention. Some texts may confuse the two uses, using i and j interchangeably, so we'll show you how to consistently handle signs. The confusion comes from the initial choice of phasor rotation direction with increasing time, which ultimately decides all the signs in the system.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Taking into account the functional dependence {\$}\backslashvarepsilon=\backslashvarepsilon(E,B){\$} and {\$}\backslashmu=\backslashmu(E,B){\$} for the dielectric coefficients, a set of phenomena related to the birefringence of the electromagnetic waves induced by external fields are derived and discussed.

abstract = {The existence of the curse of dimensionality is well known, and its general effects are well acknowledged. However, and perhaps due to this colloquial understanding, specific measurements on the curse of dimensionality and its effects are not as extensive. In continuous domains, the volume of the search space grows exponentially with dimensionality. Conversely, the number of function evaluations budgeted to explore this search space usually grows only linearly. The divergence of these growth rates has important effects on the parameters used in particle swarm optimization and differential evolution as dimensionality increases. New experiments focus on the effects of population size and key changes to the search characteristics of these popular metaheuristics when population size is less than the dimensionality of the search space. Results show how design guidelines developed for low-dimensional implementations can become unsuitable for high-dimensional search spaces.},

abstract = {The polarization of light is one of the most remarkable phenomena in nature and has led to numerous discoveries and applications. The nature and mathematical formulation of unpolarized light and partially polarized light were not readily forthcoming until the 1950s, when questions about polarized light and the mathematical tools to deal with it began to be addressed in earnest. As a result, there is a very good understanding of polarized light today. The primary objective of this Field Guide is to provide an introduction to the developments in polarized light that have taken place over the past half-century and present the most salient topics of the subject matter such as Mueller matrices, Stokes polarization parameters, and Jones matrices.},

In this work, we demonstrate a tunable achromatic quarter-wave plate (AQWP) for the THz frequency range. The phase retardation of this device can be set at 90° ± 9° from 0.20 to 0.50 THz. The operation range from 0.20 to 0.50 THz can be tuned to from 0.30 to 0.70 THz by introducing three nematic liquid crystals phase retarders, of which the birefringence can be magnetically tuned. The frequency-dependent phase retardation is in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {A superachromatic quarter-wave retarder using an arbitrary number of waveplates in a broadband spectral range has been proposed. Their design is based on the optimization of a merit function, the achromatism degree (AcD), which represents a global behavior metric for the retardation. By means of this technique, the thickness and azimuth of each waveplate is determined. The achromatism degree is a measure of the distance between the overall retardation and a target retardation weighted by the spectrum of the incident light. We report on a particular case where all waveplates are made of quartz. As application examples, the design of a quarter-wave retarder using two, three, and four waveplates in the spectral ranges of 500-700 nm and 400-1000 nm was studied. The numerical results show that for these ranges, the best designs obtained present a maximum difference of 0.013° and 0.010° with respect to the target retardation, respectively. In addition, an analysis of their achromatic stability is presented. These results can be applied in the aerospace industry, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and spectrogoniometry, among others.},

abstract = {Wire grids have been fabricated with microscopic elements and periodicity. These wire grids behave as linear polarizers over large portions of the infrared spectrum, confirming predictions from electromagnetic theory. The method of fabrication of grids with periods as small as 463 m/u is described. Limits on the per- formance of a wire-grid polarizer are set by fineness of period, optical constants of the metal, spectral trans- mission of the supporting substrate, and by skin-depth effects. Within these limits, excellent polarizer performance may be obtained over a very wide band of wavelengths, and these new wire-grid polarizers do, in fact, cover the range 2-15, and beyond. Appreciable polarization is observed at near-infrared and visible wavelengths. Wire grids may be used in convergent beams of radiation or in restricted geometrical arrange- ments, unlike many pile-of-plate or prism polarizers. These wire-grid polarizers have proved useful in meas- uring the imperfections of other types of infrared polarizers.},

abstract = {In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time-scales rang-ing from real-time operation to long-term plan-ning. This process often involves solving sim-ilar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under stringent time requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this solution process to directly learn the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need of solving computationally expensive large-scale paramet-ric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active con-straints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables more interpretable learning poli-cies, and inherently accounts for relevant safety constraints. Further, the number of relevant ac-tive sets is finite, which make them simpler ob-jects to learn. To learn the relevant active sets, we propose a streaming algorithm backed up by the-oretical results. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks of the Optimal Power Flow prob-lem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that this is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning al-gorithm to target.},

abstract = {The classification of polarization properties of polarization elements is studied to derive data-reduction equations for extracting the diattenuation, retardance, and other polarization properties from their Jones matrices. Polarization elements, and Jones matrices as well, are divided into two classes: homogeneous, with orthogonal eigenpolarizations, and inhomogeneous, with nonorthogonal eigenpolarizations. The basic polarization properties, diattenuation and retardance, of homogeneous polarization elements are straightforward and well known; these elements are characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenpolarizations. Polarization properties of inhomogeneous polarization elements are not so evident. By applying polar decomposition, the definitions of diattenuation and retardance are generalized to inhomogeneous polarization elements, providing an understanding of their polarization characteristics. Furthermore, an inhomogeneity parameter is introduced to describe the degree of inhomogeneity in a polarization element. These results are then adapted to degenerate polarization elements, which have only one linearly independent eigenpolarization.},

abstract = {We derive conditions for the physical realizability of polarization matrices characterizing passive systems or scattering media. By physically realizable, we mean that 0≤g≤1 where g ≡ (output intensity/input intensity). Using the singular-value decomposition of an arbitrary 2 × 2 complex-valued matrix, we prove that a Jones matrix TJ is physically realizable if 0 ≤ det (Formula Presented) ≤ 1. Consequently singular Jones matrices (i.e. det TJ =0) completely extinguish the output intensity irrespective of the input intensity because g≡0. Corresponding results are obtained for Mueller-Jones matrices (the 4 × 4 real-valued matrices which are the four-dimensional representations of the two-dimensional 2 × 2 complex-valued Jones matrices). We also study the problem for general Mueller matrices; however because of their phenomenological character they do not admit of such criteria as do the Jones and Mueller-Jones matrices. This is because g now depends upon the matrix elements of the Mueller matrix and the input Stokes parameters; whereas for the Jones and Mueller–Jones matrices, g only depends upon the matrix elements. Finally we study the problem of relating the input and output mean randomness. {\textcopyright} 1987 Taylor {\&} Francis Ltd.},

The simulated results show that the linear polarization conversion efficiency is over 97{\%} with over 90{\%} reflectance across an 800 nm bandwidth. Moreover, simulated and experimental results indicate that such broadband and high-efficiency performance is also sustained over a wide range of incident angles. To further obtain a background-free half-wave plate, we arrange such a plate as a periodic array of integrated supercells made of several plasmonic antennas with high linear polarization conversion efficiency, consequently achieving a reflection-phase gradient for the cross-polarized beam. In this design, the anomalous (cross-polarized) and the normal (copolarized) reflected beams become spatially separated, hence enabling highly efficient and robust, background-free polarization conversion along with broadband operation. Our results provide strategies for creating compact, integrated, and high-performance plasmonic circuits and devices.},

abstract = {Liquid crystals have revolutionized visual display systems and are the most common displays in the entertainment, computer, and mobile technology industries. The key to their use is their ability to affect and manipulate polarized light. Liquid crystals have the property of birefringence; i.e., the refractive index of the material depends on the propagation direction and the polarization of the light. In liquid crystals birefringence can be used to transform linearly polarized light to elliptically polarized light. This can be demonstrated where light blocked by passage through two crossed polarizers can be made to pass through crossed polarizers when a liquid crystal material is placed between the polarizers. In this chapter we will discuss polarization and birefringence in the context of the optical properties of liquid crystals, with a general introduction of optics.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We report a correlation between the dielectric property and structure of stretched poly(lactic acid) (PLA) films, revealed by polarization-sensitive terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and two-dimensional (2D) wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The experiments evidence that the dielectric function of the PLA film becomes more anisotropic with increasing draw ratio (DR). This behavior is explained by a classical Lorentz oscillator model assuming polarization-dependent absorption. The birefringence can be systematically altered from 0 to 0.13 by controlling DR. The combination of terahertz spectroscopy and 2D WAXS measurement reveals a clear correlation between the birefringence in the terahertz frequency domain and the degree of orientation of the PLA molecular chains. These findings imply that the birefringence is a result of the orientation of the PLA chains with anisotropic macromolecular vibration modes. Because of a good controllability of the birefringence, polymer-based materials will provide an attractive materials system for phase retarders in the terahertz frequency range.},

abstract = {Terahertz region in Electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is almost unexplored area of research due to inefficient devices for generation and detection of Terahertz signals. It leads to Terahertz Gap in EM spectrum. Modelling of efficient antennas for terahertz generation is not similar to conventional antenna design. Terahertz Photoconductive Antenna (PCA) are mostly used antenna for terahertz signal generation and detection. In PCA, multi-physics are involved such as Opto-electronics, Semiconductor physics {\&} EM theory. Opto-electronics for femtosecond Laser (Gaussian) beam interaction with semiconductor substrate, Semiconductor physics for Photo excited carrier dynamics and Electromagnetic{\&}Antenna Theory for wave propagation of Terahertz radiation. For proper modelling of radiation from a PCA {\&} design of antenna as part of PCA, High Frequency Structural Simulator(HFSS) can be used, provided the other physical phenomenon as mentioned earlier are properly accessed for in reading the excitation for the antenna element. And also antenna characteristics can be studied. In the present work, Near field {\&} Far field patterns and near field to far field transformations have been studied using HFSS simulation considering simplified models. },

abstract = {We propose and demonstrate a type of a broadband half-wave plate that operates in the reflective mode. It consists of a metal grating embedded in a dielectric slab and placed on top of a grounded metal surface. We theoretically show that owing to the optical feedback effect which originates from the wave reflections at the air-dielectric interface, the proposed half-wave plate exhibits a broadened and flattened response when comparing to the case where the feedback effect is absent. Such a prediction is validated using both numerical and experimental works carried out on a half-wave plate designed at 10 GHz. Moreover, our theoretical analysis also reveals that the half-wave plate has an interesting feature of broad angular response. Taking advantage of these features, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed device can function as a freely tunable linear polarization converter with polarization conversion residues less than -20 dB in a wide frequency band, under the condition that the incident angle is as large as 45 degrees.},

THz time-domain spectroscopy characterization, performed on both flat and curved configurations, reveals a high extinction ratio between 40 and 45 dB in the 0.3-1 THz range and in excess of 30 dB up to 2.5 THz. The insertion losses are lower than 1 dB and are almost exclusively due to moderate Fabry-Perot reflections, which vanish at targeted frequencies. The polarizer can be easily fabricated with low-cost techniques such as roll-to-roll and/or large-area electronics processes and promises to open the way for a new class of flexible and conformal THz devices.},

The basin-hopping scheme allows an improved refinement of the required thicknesses and rotations to give a predicted phase error from the ideal $\pi$/2 of only 0.5{\%}, which is a factor of approximately 6 better than previous efforts. Moreover, the large contrast between extraordinary and ordinary axes of sapphire allows us to greatly decrease the overall optical path length of our wave plate design by approximately a factor of 10 over similar designs based on quartz discs. However, this very same contrast requires very precise tolerances in the milled thicknesses of the discs and their assembly. We detail a method to compensate for differences in the thickness from their calculated ideal values.

The disc thicknesses and relative rotations of the discs are determined through a basin-hopping Monte Carlo thermal annealing routine. The basin-hopping scheme allows an improved refinement of the required thicknesses and rotations to give a predicted phase error from the ideal $\pi$/2 of only 0.5{\%}, which is a factor of approximately 6 better than previous efforts. Moreover, the large contrast between extraordinary and ordinary axes of sapphire allow us to greatly decrease the overall optical path length of our wave plate design by approximately a factor of 10 over similar designs based on quartz discs. However, this very same contrast requires very precise tolerances in the milled thicknesses of the discs and their assembly. We detail a method to compensate for differences in the thickness from their calculated ideal values. We have constructed one of our designs and found it similar in performance to other configurations, but with our much more compact geometry.},

In contrast, the morphology of inhomogeneous systems exhibits phase singularities, where the Pancharatnam–Berry phase is undetermined. The results show an alternative to extract polarization properties such as diattenuation and retardance, and can be used to study the transformation of space-variant polarized beams.},

abstract = {Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the twentieth century, and probably the most influential book in optics published in the past 40 years. The new edition is the first ever thoroughly revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new material, much of which is not available in any other optics text, is a section on the CAT scan (computerized axial tomography), which has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the CAT scan - to which Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg's law, the Ewald sphere of reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf, namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices, including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.},

We also develop a neural network to make predictions for input probe pulses which propagate through a nonlinear dispersive medium, which may be applied to predicting optimal pulse shapes for a desired output. The setup requires only a single pulse for the probe, providing considerable simplification of the current method of dispersion characterization that requires frequency scanning across the entirety of the gain and absorption features. We show that the trained networks are able to predict pulse profiles as well as dispersive features that are nearly identical to their experimental counterparts. We anticipate that the use of machine learning in conjunction with optical communication and sensing methods, both classical and quantum, can provide signal enhancement and experimental simplifications even in the face of highly complex, layered nonlinear light-matter interactions.},

For the first time, the developed algorithms are evaluated on real detector calibration data. The accuracy of reconstruction either reaches or exceeds what was achieved by the conventional approaches developed by EXO-200 over the course of the experiment. Most existing DNN approaches to event reconstruction and classification in particle physics are trained on Monte Carlo simulated events. Such algorithms are inherently limited by the accuracy of the simulation.

Wave physics, as found in acoustics and optics, is a natural candidate for building analog processors for time-varying signals. Here we identify a mapping between the dynamics of wave physics, and the computation in recurrent neural networks. This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inversely-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio data by simple propagation of waves through such a medium, achieving performance that is comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Crystal formation is a highly debated problem. This report shows that the crystallization of l-(+)-tartaric acid from water follows a non-classical path involving intermediate hydrated states. Analytical ultracentrifugation indicates solution clusters of the initial stages aggregate to form an early intermediate. Terahertz spectroscopy performed during water evaporation highlights a transient increase in the absorption during nucleation; this indicates the recurrence of water molecules that are expelled from the intermediate phase. Besides, a transient resonance at 750GHz, which can be assigned to a natural vibration of large hydrated aggregates, vanishes after the final crystal has formed. Furthermore, THz data reveal the vibration of nanosized clusters in the dilute solution indicated by analytical ultracentrifugation. Infrared spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering highlight that the intermediate is not a crystalline hydrate. These results demonstrate that nanoscopic intermediate units assemble to form the first solvent-free crystalline nuclei upon dehydration.},

abstract = {The importance of conductivity Conductivity measurement is an extremely widespread and useful method, especially for quality control purposes. Surveillance of feedwater purity, control of drinking water and process water quality, estimation of the total number of ions in a solution or direct measurement of components in process solutions can all be performed using conductivity measurements. The high reliability, sensitivity and relatively low cost of conductivity instrumentation makes it a potential primary parameter of any good mon-itoring program. Some applications are measured in units of resistivity, the inverse of conductivity. Other applications require the measurement of total dissolved solids (TDS), which is related to conductivity by a fac-tor dependent upon the level and type of ions present. Conductivity measurements cover a wide range of solution conductivity from pure water at less than 1x10 -7 S/cm to values of greater than 1 S/cm for concentrated solutions. In general, the measurement of conductivity is a rapid and inexpensive way of determining the ionic strength of a solution. However, it is a non-specific technique, unable to distinguish between different types of ions, giving instead a reading that is proportional to the combined effect of all the ions present. This booklet The subject of this booklet is the measurement of conductivity, i.e. the ability of an aqueous solution to carry an electrical current. Reliable and accurate measurements depend on a number of factors: the concentra-tion and mobility of ions, presence of organic alcohols and sugars, va-lence of ions, temperature, etc. The scope of this booklet is to discuss the theoretical aspects of conductivity, the factors that influence the reliability of the measurement, and the techniques. Sections covering the applications, rules for reliable measurements and frequently asked questions have been included to make this a comprehensive review of the importance of conductivity measurements.},
